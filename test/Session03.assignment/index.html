        <p>Random Wall of Text</p>
        <p>Hi since this is a supposed to be a wall of text</p>
        <h2 id="top">A Great Start</h2>
        <p>Then I'm going to just randomly write stuff</p>
        <p>Because I don't actually think anyone will read this</p>
        <p>In commemoration, I wanted to share that I won my first game in Fall guys</p>
        <p>Hope that explains my choice of background and image</p>
        <p>I don't know if it's illegal, but I want to add an image</p>
        <p>Ok... wait let me add the image now</p>
        <p>Ok adding...</p>
        <img class="fallguywin" src="../resources/Fallguyswin.jpg">
        <p>To play safe, I'm going to add more chunk of text</p>
        <p>I guess I just want to say that I'm so happy I won my first game</p>
        <p>And my bro won the next one, and I won the one after that</p>
        <h2 id="bottom">Conquer Fall Mountain!</h2>
        <p>All that is left to do is to conquer Fall Mountain</p>
        <p> Just because I want to make it more obvious that you're being brought to this point, I'm just going to write a random chunk of text. Please ignore whatever you read here because I'm literally just going to be repeating this over and over again. Ok, I am really just typing whatever is appearing in my mind. I don't even care for my grammar or anything. Just going to write endlessly and endlessly until I can create a long enough paragraph to make my bottom seem like bottom ok thanks bye. Ok you know what, it still isn't long enough, omg this is so tiring. There is no end to this madness. But anyway, just some filler text would be uhm let me see... I'm not sure but I want to thank Google for existing. Because of Google, I can find out how to do the stupid create a link to jump from one place in the page to another. OMG! It was a headache, but nevertheless, it's fun! HAHAHA! Idk why but I guess I really love mods that is application-based. Ok, is it time to end this paragraph? Let's refresh the page. I'm going to just leave it be, hopefully it's clear enough!</p>
