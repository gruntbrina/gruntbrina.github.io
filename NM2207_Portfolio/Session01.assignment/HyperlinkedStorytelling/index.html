        Night has fallen, and you're making your way home from work. As you're walking through the usual park, you notice a lady standing in the corner of the park. Something about the lady put you off, but you could not lay a finger as to what. As you walk pass her, she suddenly reaches out to grab your arm. She then proceeds to ask you "Am I pretty?". Alarmed, scared, and the park seemingly deserted, how would you react?
